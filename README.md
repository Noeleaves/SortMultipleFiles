# SortMultipleFiles
Hi this is FeiGan
I wrote a program to merge K files into one file where each file containing numbers in ascending order. 
The result file shoule also contains numbers in ascending order.
This project can be applied to sort a large amount of numbers which can't be loaded in memory.
Hope you like it.
